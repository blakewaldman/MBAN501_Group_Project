# Introduction

## The Promises of AI {-}

“Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands on the precipice of dramatically reshaping our world, unlocking potentials that have been largely the domain of science fiction. AI has the capability to revolutionize sectors from healthcare to finance, automating and enhancing tasks with a speed and accuracy that surpass human ability. It can predict patterns in complex data, opening doors for breakthroughs in medical diagnoses and climate modeling. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we can create more personalized user experiences, from smart homes to bespoke online content. AI can also boost economic productivity, catalyzing growth, and fostering innovation.”

**Actually, the entire paragraph you just read was written by ChatGPT. Cool, right?** 

## The Risks of AI {-}

Artificial intelligence, AI, is impressive in simple terms, but its capacity to mimic human thought and behavior doesn't come without risks. Artificial intelligence can impact everyday life both in a positive and negative way. It has the possibility to impact the environment negatively, as well as increase the digital divide that is already present in modern day society. 

Along with this, humans may lose a sense of privacy and security over their own data and life. It’s also critical to consider what can happen when the AI space has a small number of powerful entities. These firms may be increasingly likely to leverage their own technologies to move and educate people in ways that they desire. Furthermore, as AI technology develops and becomes more accurate and accessible, society could become overly reliant on it to complete mundane tasks. Considering this, there may be incredible interruptions in our society when the technology eventually ‘breaks’ or has errors. 

## Our Aim {-}

We plan to dive into some of the biggest risks and challenges that our world faces today because of AI’s development.

When writing the content found in this site, we made the assumption that our readers may not be extremely familiar with the technical details of AI. As a result, we tailored our approach accordingly. Our goal is to provide a simple, yet thought-provoking introduction to some potential challenges of AI to any individual who is looking to learn more, no matter where they are from, their age, or their educational background.
