# Market Concentration

## Market Overview {-}

The AI market size is expected to increase more than $2 trillion over the next 10 years with tech giants leading the revolution. These companies hold tremendous power and have a responsibility to “foster innovation” [@Precedence_Research_2023]. The big tech corporations dominating the AI market include Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. These firms have established their presence and invested vast resources into the future of AI. For example, Open AI lost $540 million in 2022 developing ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 [@Chowdhury_2023]. These AI algorithms require massive amounts of data and computing power, which can be costly. Without these two factors, models would essentially be useless. However, as the amounts of these factors increase, the smarter the model can become.

## Power of Data {-}
The data and power of the tech giants is unmatched, and the infinite data collection cycle that they operate under places them at an advantage [@Niyazov_2023]. They gather consumer data from the millions of users that they currently interact with, which can be used to improve AI algorithms and user experiences, ultimately attracting more users and retaining current ones.

## Competition {-}

Furthermore, as AI advances and human dependence on such tools increase, these firms will have greater power to control not only pricing but also the way that tasks are completed [@Eliot_2020]. These companies have essentially created an oligopoly within the industry, making it difficult for newcomers to enter the market. Certain AI startups have been successful in establishing their position within the market with the help of partnerships and acquisitions. For example, Intel acquired Habana Labs Ltd., a company focused on deep learning, and IBM Watson Health partnered with Guerbet, a medical imaging company [@Artificial_Intelligence_Market_Size_Share_Growth_Report_2030]. Both of these unions were meant to promote the organizations’ presence within the AI market and expedite the rate at which these organizations could develop AI tools. Being the first to launch an AI product puts the company at a competitive advantage.

Additionally, the competition among these top tech companies has pushed one another to be more innovative. After the introduction of ChatGPT, tech companies were fast to respond with their own versions of AI chatbots. Google created Bard, Apple partnered with Hugging Face to develop a similar platform, and various Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Tencent, have reportedly undertaken the same venture [@Hart_2023]. The acknowledgement of AI power has increased the demand for the development of such models, leading to a spike in demand for skilled professionals that surpasses the supply, posing another competitive factor in the AI race.

In economics, a natural monopoly is where market conditions heavily favor the incumbent. The AI market exhibits many of these characteristics but with several companies, making it a natural oligopoly. A good example of a natural monopoly is public utilities [@Eliot_2020]. After there is infrastructure built at a large upfront cost, there is little incentive for new entrants to the market. This was the case with AT&T until the 1980s. They had all the infrastructure to operate and it was too costly for new competitors to enter the market. This is what is happening with AI. As more and more data and computing power is needed to make competitive useful models, the cost to create increases quickly. This leads to the few companies that invested in AI early and kept up its development having control of all the AI models on the market.

## Call to Action {-}

  1. **Support Small**: It can be enticing to use AI tools created by familiar tech giants; however, you must be aware that there are other companies with effective models that need help to break into the greater AI world.
  2. **Regulations**: Governments should monitor and regulate tech giants early on in AI development to allow competition to thrive.
