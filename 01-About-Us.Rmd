# About Us

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (`#`) per .Rmd file.

I'm a graduate of Case Western Reserve University with majors in Finance and Data Science and a minor in Economics. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

During my time at Case Western, I served as a teaching assistant for Statistics and managed a significant part of The Weatherhead Fund's portfolio. Additionally, I held leadership roles in Alpha Kappa Psi and Zeta Beta Tau fraternities, enhancing my team management and strategic planning skills.

Proficient in languages such as Java, Python, R, and SQL, I'm also experienced in tools like Google Suite, Microsoft Office, SPSS, NoSQL databases, and XML. My passion lies in leveraging the power of data to drive business decisions. Outside of work, I enjoy fishing, baking, and racket sports.

    In my past experience, I have had exposure into various programming languages, such as Python, C++, JavaScript, and SQL. I have designed and managed databases as well as automated manually processes to improve organizational efficiencies.

I am from Binghamton, NY and the youngest of 3 (I have an older brother and older sister). I love roaming the streets of New York City and hope to move there after graduation. I enjoy baking and trying new recipes, doing the New York Times crossword puzzle, exercising, and playing the piano.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
