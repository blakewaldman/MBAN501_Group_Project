<p>Hi! I am Sierra, a current Master of Business Analytics student from the suburbs of Chicago, specifically Plainfield, Illinois. I recently graduated from the University of Michigan with my Bachelor of Business Administration from the Ross School of Business.

<p>I am a current Masters of Business Analytics student at the Ross School of Business from Westchester County, NY. I graduated from University of Michigan College of Literature, Science and Arts this past May (‘23) with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics. Last summer I interned at a software company in Boston and this was my first real introduction to the world of data analytics. I had a wonderful experience and it undoubtedly contributed to my reasons for applying to the MBAn program.</p>
<p>I have experience coding in both C++ and Python as well as MATLAB and Simulink. I am the middle child of three girls, my older sister Hannah is 26 and my younger sister Emma is 18. I have a German Shepherd name Gauge who seems like the devil but is a sweetheart in reality. In my free time I enjoy going to workout classes, running, playing board and/or card games with my friends, cooking and baking.</p>

## Griffin Hockenberry

I am a current Master of Business Analytics student at the Ross School of Business. I grew up in the suburbs of Maryland outside of Washington D.C. In May of 2023 I completed a Bachelors of Science in Economics and Environmental Policy from the University of Michigan’s College of Literature, Science, and Arts.During my undergraduate degree, I was involved in Model United Nations at the University of Michigan (MUNUM) and M-etrics, a club where members would help teach each other data analytics/econometric techniques. In 2021 I completed a finance internship at a small government contractor working with satellites in Frederick, Maryland called Knight Sky

In my free time I like to listen to music, play guitar, and hike, especially if I can make it to a National Park. I am the middle sibling with an older and younger brother.  After graduating from the MBAn program I hope to work in environmental policy or Impact analysis.
