# The Rest: Miscellaneous AI Considerations

### Humans vs. Tech: Challenges AI Faces Against Humans {-}
With the increase in access to generative AI has come the stressful discussion about whether or not machines will be able to replace the human race. Enamored with the new found ability of machines, individuals are becoming increasingly nervous that they are replaceable. While there is some validity to these fears, there are still many skills and abilities humans possess that keep them at a higher intellectual level than artificial intelligence. These challenges that machines face are what separates artificial intelligence from becoming human. 

One of the most crucial differences between artificial intelligence and human intelligence is the ability to think [@Simplilearn_2023]. Artificial intelligence learns from data and processes such as machine learning and deep learning where information is constantly being fed into the machine in order to advance its knowledge. Humans on the other hand learn from thinking; reflecting on past experiences, analyzing abstract concepts and reasoning are all things that humans can do and machines cannot [@Joshi_2022].

Additionally, there are also skills that humans possess that machines never will be able to despite rapid technological advancements. For one, humans have personalities. While machine learning and deep learning are the ways in which a computer can learn to mimic a human’s actions, they cannot be trained to have a personality [@Joshi_2022]. Similar to this is the human ability to reason and pass judgment logically. Although machines can regurgitate or reframe existing information, they aren’t able to develop new theories or ideas on their own; this skill still remains exclusive to humans [@Joshi_2022]. Moreover, humans have the ability to pass judgements based on values and ethics. We can decipher what is right from what is wrong when we are calculating our decisions. Machines on the other hand don’t have the capacity to reason on a philosophical level separating them from their human counterparts [@Marr_2022]. 

### Humans vs. Tech: Challenges Humans Face Against AI {-}
Despite the certain limitations AI faces, there is no doubt that this machinery still poses a threat to the human race. While AI may not be able to possess the advanced logical thinking skills humans have, there is no doubt that artificial intelligence can replace certain job positions that were once tailored exclusively to humans. A machine's ability to compute and analyze large amounts of data in a short amount of time gives it a significant advantage over a human who may need a week to complete tasks that AI can do in 5 minutes [@Thomas_2023]. 


## Bad Intentions {-}
### Biased Information {-}
Additionally, there are certain dangers AI poses in a social aspect. AI algorithms used in applications such as TikTok generate new content for individuals based on what the machine thinks the human is most interested in [@Thomas_2023]. This poses a significant problem since AI’s assumptions about what humans want to see isn’t always accurate and can lead to the production of certain tailored content that may or may not be true [@Thomas_2023]. This also encapsulates another risk of AI which is its lack of transparency with regards to where it is gathering its data from [@Thomas_2023]. If these sources are biased then the information humans view through these artificial intelligence programs isn’t entirely accurate which can lead to misinformation. 

### Weapon Development {-}
One of the more severe unintended consequences of artificial intelligence is the development of artificial intelligence powered weapons. While this may seem like a stretch, in reality it is actually far from it as illustrated through the actualization of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems [@Thomas_2023]. In fact, we can already see the beginning of these advancements through the Israeli Harpy Drone which essentially moves and locates a specific target before killing the individual [@Lee_2022]. We’ve seen something similar before in history when we switched from landmines in warfare to the development of nuclear weapons [@Lee_2022]. This fear has sparked debate over whether it is smarter to race into the AI arms battle or try to actively prevent it [@Thomas_2023]. These artificial intelligence powered weapons would prove to be smarter, stronger and more powerful than any alternative human power weapon, which despite being a more effective warfare weapon, could have much more severe implications [@Lee_2022]. Thus, while there is the possibility that these weapons could have beneficial results in terms of warfare, they also pose very serious and very deadly implications in the greater scheme of things.

### Legal Challenges {-}
An often overlooked challenge of artificial intelligence comes from the potential legal repercussions of using this software. Artificial intelligence has the ability to create new content off of existing data. Thus, when companies are looking to distribute this AI generated content it is crucial to make sure they have all the necessary patents, licenses or copyright information to do so, otherwise this could result in intellectual property theft [@Marr_2023]. Moreover, it might be necessary to adjust current laws or create new ones to address the implications of using AI [@Marr_2023]. This is also essential as it helps determine liability in situations where there are severe consequences to utilizing artificial intelligence [@Marr_2023]. 

### Integration Risks {-}
One of the most alluring qualities of artificial intelligence is the ability to integrate into systems in order to standardize processes and in most cases make these processes more efficient. However, what is often left out is the consequences that ensue when integration fails or isn’t properly facilitated. Additionally, it is often easy for individuals to forget that artificial intelligence isn’t always correct, and thus they are less likely to override systems enabled by this software as they believe that the machine is always correct [@Cheatham_Javanmardian_Samandari_2019]. This could lead to disastrous consequences such as, in the case of the self driving car example, a disastrous collision [@Cheatham_Javanmardian_Samandari_2019]. This is also a result of humans' lack of knowledge on artificial intelligence, not knowing the full capabilities of the machine as well as its weaknesses can result in sub-optimal human decisions.

## Conclusion {-}
<u>Summary of Key Findings</u>

As more and more individuals start utilizing artificial intelligence, it is important to keep in mind the possible repercussions of both this generative AI and its byproducts. With respect to generative AI, it is crucial to understand where these machines are gathering their data from in order to avoid misinformation and any legal consequences. Similarly, with respect to the byproducts of generative AI, it is necessary to be aware of the broader implications of artificial intelligence in order to hedge any potential consequences of nefarious use.

<u>Call to Action</u><br>
Consider these actions that can be conducted on an individual basis in order to help mitigate the potential risks and challenges associated with artificial intelligence:

  1. Avoid over relying on artificial intelligence. Keep in mind that AI has its limitations and that humans possess certain unique qualities and skills that distinguish them from machines.
  2.  Do your own research. When using generative AI to obtain information, conduct your own research to fact check the artificial intelligence generated data.
  3. Stay educated. Educate yourself on the long-term impacts of artificial intelligence and keep up with current events in order to guide your own decision making regarding using AI.
